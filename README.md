Week 7-8: Ethical/Licensing Notes

The Federal Funds data was found publicly on Kaggle, and was collected from trustworthy sources. The S&P 500 data was collected from investing.com which is a global financial data nad news platform. Both our datasets have trustworthy origins and we looked into the origins of our data and found that the datasets don't have any ethical or licensing issues.

Week 9: Data Cleaning 

After doing an exploratory check of the dataset, we pivoted to a new direction for our project as the previous datasets had too many rows and missing values. More importantly, we realized that looking at a previous 70 year period would be impractical as it could force the data to find relationships that aren't true just to fit (overfitting) and decided narrowing down to 10 years would reduce overfitting and be relevant to our lives. The data within both datasets were cleaned to have the same date range and removed any empty values. In conclusion, we changed our research question to look for a relationship between 2018-2025.





We completed the code for this project in a Jupyter Notebook and completed the report in a Google Document. We have successfully uploaded them over into this GitHib repository.
